# Bio Workflow Engine (BioWF)
.NET Bioinformatics Workflow designer and execution engine.

## Welcome to the BioWF project

The BioWF project is a recreation of the Trident Scientific Workbench from MSR but using Windows Workflow 4.5 and .NET Bio 1.1. It allows you to create programs visually by connecting various components together in the designer and then persist them to an XML file which can either be run in the GUI designer, or from a command line tool.

You can either download the source code from the source code tab, or a binary installer which will give you the code already compiled and create a start menu icon for the GUI designer.

## Examples
Check out http://julmar.com/blog/mark/?p=323 for a very simple example of how to use it.

## Compiling the code

The source code uses .NET Bio 1.1 and MVVMHelpers - both are available on NuGet.  You may need to fix the references to the projects - this is most easily done with Nuget (right click on references and select Manage Nuget References).
